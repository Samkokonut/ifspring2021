        <h1>Intro Questions</h1>
        <p>1. Name: Samantha Ko, Major: communication design, Year: Sophomore</p> 
        <p>2. I am a Sam Fox student in the Beyond Boundaries Program, which encourages exploration of different disciplines. I thought it would be interesting to learn about something that I had no experience with to add some skills to my tool belt. When I saw website design in the description, I thought that this class would give me some helpful tools for later in the future. I believe that online design is the future since everything seems to be online nowadays, so I feel like this class will give me some introduction and basic skills in this field of design. </p>
        <p>3. I do not have any experience with HTML or CSS, which is why Iâ€™m taking this course!</p> 
        <p>4. I hope to learn the basics of website design and a little bit of coding as well.</p>
        <p>5. Since coding is like learning a different language, I feel like there will be a learning curve that is not present when I design by hand currently. I will have to learn the basics of code in order to create better designs.</p>
        <p>6. I think that the apple website has effective design because it is so easy to navigate and extremely aesthetically pleasing.</p>
            <p>https://www.apple.com</p>
        <p>7. I think the National Geographic website has effective communication because it is straightforward and is informative.</p>

        <p>8. I think that the amazon website works well because it is easy to navigate and use.</p>
            <p>https://www.amazon.com </p>
